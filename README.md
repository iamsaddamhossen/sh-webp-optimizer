# Saddam Hossen WebP Optimizer

> **High-performance, zero-cost, native image optimization for WordPress.**

---

## 🚀 Why This Plugin?
Most image optimization plugins (like Smush or ShortPixel) use external SaaS servers, which often require monthly subscriptions and send your private data away. This plugin runs **locally** on your server.

* **Privacy:** Your images never leave your server.
* **Cost:** No API keys, no monthly fees, no limits.
* **Speed:** Uses the powerful PHP Imagick library for instant conversion.

---

## ✨ Features
* **Auto-Conversion:** Automatically intercepts JPG, PNG, and GIF uploads and converts them to WebP.
* **Smart Resizing:** Automatically resizes massive 4K uploads to a web-friendly maximum width (default 1920px).
* **Manual Tool:** Includes a "Convert to WebP" button in the Media Library for older, existing images.
* **EXIF Correction:** Intelligently auto-rotates mobile photos based on metadata.
* **Smart Fallback:** Only replaces the original if the WebP version is actually smaller.

---

## 📋 System Requirements
To ensure high-performance processing, this plugin utilizes native server resources:
* **PHP:** 7.4 or higher.
* **PHP Extension:** `imagick` (ImageMagick) must be enabled on your server.
* **WordPress:** 5.0 or higher.
